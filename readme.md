# ShoppingList Example Code

This is a final version of the code for the shopping list exercise.

The user is able to add new items to the list using the input box and button.
The function to *complete* all the items is available and can be run from the console, but is not connected to any button.

There are still the couple of issues that we left the app with :-

* Items get duplicated when adding more after the first
* The name input doesn't get cleared

There is a branch called *fixes* which has code to fix these problems, so you can see how that can be done.
